## Backlog

Flight booking confirmation
- When an user buy a flight he will receive and email confirming the reserve and the flight details.

First vs Turist class
- A user will pay different prices depending on the seats he wants to occupy in the airplain.
- First class seats will be more confortable and will include extra services, however, these extra services will make the price expensive.
- Turist class seats will not have the extra services the first class seats have, therefore the price will be more economic.

Price setting
- Set prices depending on when the user is making the booking. The sooner he buys the flight the cheeper it will be.

Flight extras
